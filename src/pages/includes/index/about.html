						Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and
						statistics show that only 20% of them will find a
						family. The others will continue to live with us and
						will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly
						loved.
					</p>
					<p class="arial">
						We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that
						they do not get sick, feel comfortable (including
						psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87
						volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels.
						About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff.
						Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the
						pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
